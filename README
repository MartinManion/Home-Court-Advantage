Home Court Advantage on Free Throw Percentage

This project aimed to see how away teams fared shooting free throws in NBA games. The hypothesis was that home court advantage is a measurable phenomenon. 

Data collected included attendance, distance from home stadium, number of all stars on the away team, and if the game is an in-conference contest. 

Using STATA, each variable was tested individually and jointly for significance. 

The only variable found to have a significant effect on free throw percentage is Number of All Stars.
